# Overview

## Things that are probably strengths

My belief that people are inherently good, or just misunderstood, often makes me a bit of an idealist and causes me to stick my neck out for folks.

I can talk a lot in meetings, but prefer democracy whenever possible.

My favorite quote is "live-and-let-live", who likes rules anyways.

Perhaps my creative background helps me connect the odd dots, I am getting pretty darn good at debugging code.

I like to think I am dedicated or at least hard-working.

## Everyone has weaknesses, I am no different

I sometimes face the challenge of taking work and profession personally. This mostly means that I will likely work after hours to help the team or to ensure that my work is top notch, but sometimes it means I get frustrated when people waste each others time. We all have lives to go home to.

Some people say it is difficult to get to know me. Don't worry this is just because I am private, reserved, and self-conscious. More of a "it's me not you" situation. Get past that and we will likely be best pals.
