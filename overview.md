# Overview

How and why I might be the way I am.

## Things that are probably strengths

- My belief that people are inherently good, or just misunderstood, often makes me a bit of an idealist and causes me to stick my neck out for folks.

- I can talk a lot in meetings, but prefer democracy whenever possible.

- My new favorite quote is “People have only as much liberty as they have the intelligence to want and the courage to take.” -Emma Goldman

- Perhaps my creative background helps me connect the odd dots, I am getting pretty darn good at debugging code.

- I like to think I am dedicated or at least hard-working.

## Everyone has weaknesses, I am no different

- I no longer take work personally. After years of engineering I've realized that we are all just trying to solve problems, but at some point we need a person who can make the decisions.

- Some people say it is difficult to get to know me. Don't worry this is just because I am private, reserved, and self-conscious. More of a "it's me not you" situation. Get past that and we will likely be best pals.
