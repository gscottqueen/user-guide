# About

Where I have been to get me where I am.

> Early 2000's
## Engineering
Before college I worked in Non Destructive Engineering for the Power-Gen Industry.

- built robots and learned practical applications for ultrasonic diffraction testing
- breathed in *way* too much coal dust

> Circa 2010
## Art
My Bachelors is in Studio Design with Post-Baccalaureate studies in Aesthetics and Ethics.

- paid my way through college site building and designing promotional work for local bands and DJs
- helped establish a studio collective consisting of 14 contemporary artist in a warehouse by the beach
- served as a board member for an international art colony and non-profit to raise money for housing in 3rd world countries
- garnered some public art awards with sculpture work

> For most of the year in 2012
## Design
The first full-time gig I had out of college was designing and developing sites for Australian NASCAR driver Marcos Ambrose and his startup driver development program.

- never got to drive the race car unfortunately

> Somewhere in between 2014-2015
## Product Owner
Worked as a Digital Media Manager for a Design museum in North Carolina known as The Mint Museum.

- still one of my favorite places to have worked
- Used to sneak into the registrar area to see all the work that was not on display

> Februarish, 2016
## Project Manager
Convinced Carla and Jose Briceno it would be a good idea to hire me at Bixal as a digital driver of success.

- got a PMP, did some good project work, and way too many excel spreadsheets
- ultimately wanted to be more involved with code
- can still remember when the office only had about 8 people

> Winter of 2017
## Web Developer
After a bit of time at General Assembly learning more about Front End Development, I focused some effort working on presentation level work within Drupal. More recently have tried for deeper understanding of the broader application effort and tech stack.

#DadLife
I took some time off to be about that #DadLife, and now I have two girls, Gwyneth (2yrs) and Olivia (newborn). The world is much different now, and I am 100% ok with it. They are the coolest thing I have ever done, and I live for spending time with them.

## Present
Back at Bixal full-time, learning more about full-stack Javascript and Design Systems.
